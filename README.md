# Responsive-Portfolio

* In this second assignment I creaded three html files contain the following:
    * the created files are index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html.
    * each of these files contain the same nav bar.
    * each separate file links to each other properly as required.

* Bootstrap was used to incorporate the nav bar in the three files.
    * The link to the bootstrap cdn was properly placed within the three files.
    * Bootstrap's grid was used in both the contact and about me files.
    * the portfolio file will be organized using the grid as projects are added to it over the course.

* All links work in this HTML!
