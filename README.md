# Responsive-Portfolio

## Progress Block 1

* **In this second assignment I creaded three html files contain the following:**
    * the created files are index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html.
    * each of these files contain the same nav bar.
    * each separate file links to each other properly as required.

* **Bootstrap was used to incorporate the nav bar in the three files.**
    * The link to the bootstrap cdn was properly placed within the three files.
    * Bootstrap's grid were used in all three files.

* All links work in this HTML!

## Progress Block 2

* style.css was created and linked under the bootstrap cdn link for further formatting instructions.

* index.html contains a card named about me, which contains a placeholder image and text about me formatted using rows and columns.
  css was used here to ensure the image went through no changes to ensure the bootstrap grid formatting stayed final. 
  
* contact.html now has proper forms using bootstrap and css to organize them.  These forms were also programmed to be mobile responsive
  when the screen's wodth is less than 600 pixels.  the collums willl stack on top of one another.  This needed a media query to be possible.

* portfolio has all 5 images in a card named portfolio and are formatted using both the bootstrap grid of rows, columns, and css.
  the class imgInstructions was used to contain those css instructions for all portfolio images.
